# Degrugger
Writing an actual debugger requires a level of expertise or time I do not currently possess.
But, I do have a fair amount of ideas about how current debuggers could do a _much_ better
job at being the tools they are supposed to be. 

At the moment I do not plan this to become a production-ready debugger, more of a playtoy to test
out ideas about what additional features could help programmers in squashing nasty bugs.

It also serves like a decent intro to Rust (read: I'm absolute gobshite at it and don't know
what I'm doing), a language which I'm not super fond of, but maybe I will after this.
